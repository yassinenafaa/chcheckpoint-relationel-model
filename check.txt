Step 1: Identify Entities and Attributes
From the ER diagram (https://i.imgur.com/oHkrfiJ.png), we can identify the following entities and their attributes:

Hotel

Attributes: Hotel_ID (PK), Name, Location, Classification
Primary Key (PK): Hotel_ID
Room

Attributes: Room_ID (PK), Type, Price, Hotel_ID (FK)
Foreign Key (FK): Hotel_ID references Hotel(Hotel_ID)
Client

Attributes: Client_ID (PK), Name, Phone, Email
Primary Key (PK): Client_ID
Reservation

Attributes: Reservation_ID (PK), Date, Start_Date, End_Date, Client_ID (FK), Room_ID (FK)
Foreign Keys (FK):
Client_ID references Client(Client_ID)
Room_ID references Room(Room_ID)
Payment

Attributes: Payment_ID (PK), Amount, Payment_Date, Reservation_ID (FK)
Foreign Key (FK): Reservation_ID references Reservation(Reservation_ID)
Step 2: Identify Relationships
Based on the ER diagram:

A Hotel can have multiple Rooms, but each Room belongs to only one Hotel. This is a 1-to-many relationship between Hotel and Room.
A Client can make multiple Reservations, but each Reservation is made by exactly one Client. This is a 1-to-many relationship between Client and Reservation.
A Room can be reserved in multiple Reservations, and each Reservation involves one Room. This is a 1-to-many relationship between Room and Reservation.
A Reservation can have one or more Payments, but each Payment corresponds to one Reservation. This is a 1-to-many relationship between Reservation and Payment.
Step 3: Relational Schema (Tables)
Using the identified entities, attributes, and relationships, hereâ€™s the relational schema:

Hotel Table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Hotel (
    Hotel_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Location VARCHAR(255),
    Classification INT
);
Room Table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Room (
    Room_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Type VARCHAR(255),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Hotel_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Hotel_ID) REFERENCES Hotel(Hotel_ID)
);
Client Table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Client (
    Client_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Phone VARCHAR(15),
    Email VARCHAR(255)
);
Reservation Table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Reservation (
    Reservation_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Date DATE,
    Start_Date DATE,
    End_Date DATE,
    Client_ID INT,
    Room_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Client_ID) REFERENCES Client(Client_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Room_ID) REFERENCES Room(Room_ID)
);
Payment Table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Payment (
    Payment_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Payment_Date DATE,
    Reservation_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Reservation_ID) REFERENCES Reservation(Reservation_ID)
);
Step 4: Additional Considerations
Data Types: The data types (e.g., VARCHAR, INT, DECIMAL) should be chosen according to the expected data (e.g., the type and length of strings, the precision of monetary amounts).

Normalization: The schema adheres to 3NF (Third Normal Form), ensuring that there are no transitive dependencies and that the relationships are cleanly modeled through foreign keys.

Indexes: You might want to create indexes on foreign keys to speed up joins and lookups.

Date Formats: Ensure that the date format in your database aligns with your data's requirements (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD for standard SQL).

Relational Diagram (Overview):
The relational diagram would look like this (simplified view):
